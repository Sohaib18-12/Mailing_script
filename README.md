## How to use

Dear, I hope you're all doing good.
this code is a code using the module "smtplib" to send emails, I am using it to apply for jobs

1- The first thing you have to do is replace the file "cover.pdf" and the file "Resume.pdf" with your own resume and cover letter.

2- Then open the Excel file "Job_Track.xlsx" from the sheet personal data and fill your personal information

3- Enter the following link and get your own gmail key https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en

4- Copy and past the password you've generated in the password cell in the excel file in personal data sheet

5- Now you can start creating your company database in sheet called "data"

6- The file Body.py defines the message that you want to send you can change it if you have knowlodge with html language

7- To send the emails, open the file main.py and run it

!!!! I seggust you to try emails you have access to, to ensure that it's working properly before sending real job application !!!

The emails will start sending one by one.

For you have any questions or improvments don't hesitate to contact me, I would like to enhance it more to make more usable for non-technical people

Take care :)
